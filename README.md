#  Flowcus bar

Flowcus bar is a pomodoro-like app. It shows a progress bar always on top of any window, so you get constant feedback of how much time left you have.
It can help with time blindness and time perception. You can set the timer to 5 minutes and watch the bar progressing, and you'll realise that 5 minutes is actually a lot.
The goal is to help you focus and enter flow state. Additionally, it has an option for screen capturing your sessions for self-accountability and helping with context switching, so you can check where you left last time you worked, and review what did you do.
You can **download** it from releases folder, or this link to the [latest version](https://github.com/indiedevai/flowcus.bar/releases/download/20220322/flowcus.bar-20220322.zip).  (see installing section below for more options).
